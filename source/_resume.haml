        We built a novel stream-oriented system for publishing and subscribing to calendar events. The product allowed you to subscribe to various calendars (like bands, bars, Meetups, etc) and see them in a Twitter-style feed. Users could then add them to their calendars with one click, or republish them to their followers. The product worked really well, but we were never able to get the business model sorted out, and eventually we were forced to set it aside.

        I did all the architecture and coding as well as a good portion of the product design. The technology stack was Rails, Faye, MongoDB, and Knockout.js.

      :markdown
        I was a founding member of a team aiming to make sports information more visual and engaging. We wrote some cool software, ran some experiments, talked to users, designed some products, and had a lot of fun. Ultimately, we shelved it before it really became a company.

        Techwise, it was built with Rails, MongoDB, Erector, and JQuery.

      :markdown
        I was an early employee of a startup called Contact Networks and the architect for its flagship product, ContactNet, an enterprise who-knows-who application. I handled architecture, a big chunk of development, customer issues, planning, and beer consumption. The software itself was built in C# using a wide variety of open source libraries.

        Our startup was acquired by Thomson Reuters in 2007, and I continued my role as architect while we grew our team and product.
